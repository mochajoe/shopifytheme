## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Logo appears too large
- Go to **Theme Customizer** → **Header**
- Reduce **"Logo Height"** slider to 50-60px

### Logo appears too small
- Increase **"Logo Height"** slider to 80-90px
- Make sure you uploaded a high-resolution image

### Logo looks blurry
- Upload a higher resolution version
- Aim for 2x the display size (e.g., 560x140px for 280x70px display)

### Logo doesn't fit on mobile
- Don't worry! The theme automatically resizes:
  - Desktop: Your custom height
  - Tablet: 50px max
  - Mobile: 40px max

### Logo has white background
